# ON-model

At this repository we provide an up-to-date collection of the conformal data of the critical O(N) CFT. The format follows reference [1]. Since its publication, several papers have appeared which compute new pieces of data. These developments are summarised in the document "CFT_ON-updated-tables".

We also provide an updated version of the data file ONdata.m.

*Installation instructions.* Place the file ONdata.m in the Applications folder used by Mathematica/Wolfram (e.g. C:\ProgramData\Wolfram\Applications) and load it using the following command:

```
<<ONdata`
```

Please contact me with any suggested additions or references that I have missed.
